This application leverages machine learning and graph embeddings to predict gene-disease associations. It integrates protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from [STRING-DB](https://string-db.org/) and disease-gene associations from [Open Targets](https://platform.opentargets.org/) to create a bipartite network, where diseases and proteins are represented as nodes, and their associations as edges. **Positive edges** are derived from Open Targets, while **Negative edges** are generated from PPI database, typically at a `10:1 ratio`.

Graph-based embeddings, primarily generated using algorithms like [nodevectors](https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors), capture the structure and relationships within the graph. These embeddings are used as features in machine learning models, which predict both known and novel gene-disease associations. The app supports model training, where users can build machine learning models, with hyperparameter tuning to predict associations.. It also includes model evaluation, offering different performance metrics to assess model effectiveness. Finally, the app enables users to make predictions on gene-disease associations, with adjustable prediction thresholds, helping explore both associated and non-associated genes for a specific disease.
